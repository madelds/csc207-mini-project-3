The following changes were made to my Mini Project 3 submission in terms of my first revision:

1: I corrected and updated the code for Centered.java, so that the code:
(a) Works with a width greater than the width of the parameter block, and
(b) Works when the width given is less than the width of the parameter block.

2: I attempted to correct and update the code for Truncated.java, so that the code:
(a) Works with a width greater than the width of the parameter block, and
(b) Works when the width given is less than the width of the parameter block.

3: Added the following test cases:
(a) Tests that check the new added functionality of Centered.java as reflected in the text above.
(b) Tests for each of the different kinds of text blocks as parameters to other text blocks (or themselves).
(c) Tests that include interesting edge cases, such as empty blocks.

4: I added a CHANGES.md file to reflect the changes I made for this revision.
