Introduction:
This is Mini Project 3 ("Text Layout"), written by Madel Sibal.

Description:
The following submission contains six different procedures which each
take a text block and create a new modification of it. These procedures
are Truncated, Centered, RightJustified, HorizontallyFlipped, Vertically
Flipped, and RotatedTextBlock. Additionally, the submission contains three
additional methods which check if two textblocks are equal. These methods
are equal, eq, and eqv. Lastly, the submission contains tests and visual
examples of the code and procedures to confirm that the code works properly.

Resources:
Oracle Help Center was used in order to figure out basic Java syntax and 
techniques. In addition, the readings on Unit Testing and Subtype Polymorphism
were a big help in completing the project as they served as a basis for many
of the important concepts covered in this project. Lastly, Professor Sam helped
in clarifying the instructions of the projects during class and through his website.
I consulted with Jonathan Wang to discuss the implementation of certain procedures
and Chloe Kelly to talk about how to do the tests for this assignment.
